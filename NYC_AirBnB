# TripleTen Project 1

This is the first project I worked on with TripleTen to develop data cleaning skills necessary for data analysis

## NYC AirBnB

The goal was to analyze what was going to be profitable per neighborhood and borough in New York City, so that business decisions were applicable and reliable. 

#### The Process

I cleaned the data using techniques to verify, validify, and trim information in the cells provided to make accurate calculations within the analysis. This set up the next step of
creating Pivot Tables that would then reveal keys points in the data that could show profit between neighborhoods in NYC. Then by calculating revenue earned within the top 10
neighborhoods I was able to determine which one produced the most revenue.
