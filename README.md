\f0\fs24 \cf0 # TripleTen Project 1\
\
This is the first project I worked on with TripleTen to develop **data cleaning skills** necessary for **data analysis**.\
\
## NYC AirBnB\
\
The goal was to analyze which neighborhoods and boroughs in New York City would be the most profitable so that business decisions could be both **applicable** and **reliable**.\
\
### The Process\
\
I cleaned the data using techniques to **verify**, **validate**, and **trim** the information in the provided cells to make accurate calculations within the analysis.  \
\
This set up the next step of creating **Pivot Tables** to reveal key points in the data that could indicate profit potential between neighborhoods in NYC.  \
\
By calculating revenue earned within the **top 10 neighborhoods**, I was able to determine which one produced the **most revenue**.}
